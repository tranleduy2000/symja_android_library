## IntegerPartitions

```
IntegerPartitions(n)
```

> returns all partitions of the integer `n`.
 
```
IntegerPartitions(n, k)
```

> lists the possible ways to partition `n` into smaller integers, using up to `k` elements.

```
IntegerPartitions(n, {lower, upper}, {list-of-integers})
```

> lists the possible ways to partition `n` with the numbers in `{list-of-integers}`, using between `lower` and `upper` number of elements.
