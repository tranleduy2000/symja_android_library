## Log

```
Log(z)
```

> returns the natural logarithm of `z`.

```
Log(base, z)
```

> get the logarithm of `z` for base `base`.

For the natural logarithm functions `Ln(x)` or `Log(x)` the logarithms are taken with the natural base, `E`. 
To get a logarithm of a different base `b`, use `Log(b, x)`, which is essentially a short-hand for `Log(x)/Log(b)`. Other short-hands are `Log10(x)` for `Log(x)/Log(10)` and `Log2(x)` for `Log(x)/Log(2)`.
