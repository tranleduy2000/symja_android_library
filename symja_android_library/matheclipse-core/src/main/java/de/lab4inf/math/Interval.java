  /**
   * Interface for an interval based arithmetic.
   *
   * An interval is the closed set [l,r] = {x in REAL | with l &le; x  &le; r}.
   *
   * An interval forms an Abelian semi-group under
   * the operations of addition and multiplication
   * with algebra:
   *
   * <pre>
   *  [a,b] + [c,d] = [a+c, b+d]
   *  [a,b] - [c,d] = [a-c, b-d]
   *  [a,b] * [c,d] = [min*, max*]
   * </pre>
   *
   * Where min and max are for products
   * <pre>
   *  min* = min(ac,ad,bc,bd)
   *  max* = max(ac,ad,bc,bd)
   * </pre>
   * Special care has to be taken, if the divisor interval contains zero.
   * If not the interval borders are given by
   * <pre>
   *  [a,b]/ [c,d] = [min/, max/]
   *  min/ = min(a/c,a/d,b/c,b/d)
   *  max/ = max(a/c,a/d,b/c,b/d)
   * </pre>
   *
   * From the definition follows that the division '/'
   * is not the inverse of the multiplication '*'.
   * <br/>
   * You can resolve an Interval implementation via the L4MLoader:
   * <pre>
   *
   *   Interval w = L4MLoader.load(Interval.class);
   *
   * </pre>
   *
   * The set operations union and intersection
   * are defined as:
   * <pre>
   *  [a,b] &amp; [c,d] = [max&amp;(a,c), min&amp;(b,d)]
   *  [a,b] | [c,d] = [min(a,c) , max(b,d) ]
   * </pre>
   * In case of the the empty intersection, i.e. max&amp; &gt; min&amp;,
   * the symbolic NULL interval will be returned (not a NullPointer!).
   * <br/>
   * A product logic is provided by the operations
   * NOT, AND, OR and IMPLIES.
