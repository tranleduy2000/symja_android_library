/**
 * An array based binary weak heap. The heap is sorted according to the
 * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} of its keys, or by a
 * {@link Comparator} provided at heap creation time, depending on which
 * constructor is used.
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation uses an array in order to store the elements and
 * automatically maintains the size of the array much like a
 * {@link java.util.Vector} does, providing amortized O(log(n)) time cost for
 * the {@code insert} and {@code deleteMin} operations. Operation
 * {@code findMin}, is a worst-case O(1) operation. The bounds are worst-case if
 * the user initializes the heap with a capacity larger or equal to the total
 * number of elements that are going to be inserted into the heap.
 *
 * <p>
 * Constructing such a heap from an array of elements can be performed using the
 * method {@link #heapify(Object[])} or {@link #heapify(Object[], Comparator)}
 * in linear time.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the ordering maintained by a binary heap, like any heap, and
 * whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be <em>consistent
 * with {@code equals}</em> if this heap is to correctly implement the
 * {@code Heap} interface. (See {@code Comparable} or {@code Comparator} for a
 * precise definition of <em>consistent with equals</em>.) This is so because
 * the {@code Heap} interface is defined in terms of the {@code equals}
 * operation, but a binary heap performs all key comparisons using its
 * {@code compareTo} (or {@code compare}) method, so two keys that are deemed
 * equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the binary heap, equal. The
 * behavior of a heap <em>is</em> well-defined even if its ordering is
 * inconsistent with {@code equals}; it just fails to obey the general contract
 * of the {@code Heap} interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong> If
 * multiple threads access a heap concurrently, and at least one of the threads
 * modifies the heap structurally, it <em>must</em> be synchronized externally.
 * (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more
 * elements or changing the key of some element.) This is typically accomplished
 * by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the heap.
 *
 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by this heap
